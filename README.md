1.Overview

This project was developed during the <Academia de CÃ³digo_> hackathon after 12 weeks of an intensive and immersive 
Java && JavaScript coding bootcamp.
We've had to develop an application in 24 hours related to the theme "Money Oriented Programming".


2.Description

This app brings together the concept of a simple cripto wallet with the ability to exchange currency based on a dynamic rate.
It is also possible to transfer criptocoins beetween registered users, using email as id.

We've also inserted a special feature, a win-or-lose-all game that allows the user to win some criptocoins without facing 
the rate fluctuations.


3.Tools

JavaFx Framework.
Spring Framework.
Hibernate with JPA.
